      <h2>Plura72 has been reelected what does this mean to redmont?</h2>
<p>Plura72 elected under the RBP now having left that party and now under the Labour party has currently been the representative whom has proposed the most of bills in congress, however we have to keep in mind the Quantity &gt; Quality approach being utilized in those bills. For example the most recent bill “Amir uber Eats act” criminalizes any unauthorized breach of systems such as discord bots or others, the bill however has “words that dont exist”</p>
<h2>Papancy Act</h2>
<p>Another highly unusual act proposed by plura72 has been the papancy act which aims to nominate Masked3D_Wolf as the “pope of redmont” the current bill page counts with 27 nay reactions</p>
<h2>Co-sponsors are cringe Act</h2>
<p>This act aims to remove the need for a co-sponsor in an act, this is another highly unpopular bill counting with 14 nays</p>
<h2>Text me back lil vro act</h2>
<p>This Act lowers the text me back limit from 14 to 7 days. Many secretaries have opposed the act citing “its not enough time” it now counts with 7 nays.</p>
