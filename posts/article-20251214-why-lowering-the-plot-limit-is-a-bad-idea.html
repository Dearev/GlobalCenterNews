      <p>The house of representatives Today this 14th of December 2025, a bill has been proposed by speaker talion to lower the plot limit from 30 commercial properties to 20. Economically, this is a bad idea.</p>
<h2>The Plot crisis</h2>
<p>The plot crisis which happend across 2025 is mostly over with some properties being sold for as little as 10k, we see that more and more new players are getting access to plots and with them starting useful businesses
We belive that the main reason for that is due to the DCT and their increasingly strict eviction policy The DCT has ran at least 25 eviction auctions in the last 15 days thats an avarage of about 1.7 plots being auctioned off per day by the DCT alone without accounting for private sales
It cannot be argued that we are still currently in a crisis, and there is no point to increasingly lower the limit for commercial plots ownership in a way that harms large property owners </p>
<h2>The scope</h2>
<p>It was proven in the bill channel within the main discord that this bill would only affect 4 players, this scope is increasingly small and makes those players feel targeted;
Dearev for example as the largest property owner, remarks several times in the bill thread that he felt targeted by the bill. 
We belive this scope is unproportional, and unfit as talion himself noted
&quot;I am saying big corporations should not use plots as an asset, sorry&quot;
where winterwolf shortly commented that
&quot;Land is inherently an asset&quot;</p>
<h2>The economic point of view and possible implications</h2>
<p>businesses such as holding firms, retailers, property management firms, property refurbishment firms and property resale firms will all most likely suffer a loss at the passage of this bill, 
If signed into law we can expect large property owners to quickly liquidate their plots causing a market destabilization with at least 31 plots being sold by those large property owners due to these new compliance rules</p>
<p>if those plots are to be quickly liquidated it wouldnt be seen far fetched to see properties that are currently being sold for 9-10k by the DCT to drop in price until they are worth basically nothing (2-5k), corporations largely dependent on realestate such as Alta group (36,92%) might suffer losses from said property price drop</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>If the goverment so wants to decrease properties, several users have proposed alternatives, The biggest of which was to increase the amount of plots, by expanding reveille itself or by removing the fairgrounds which have not been in use despite multiple requests to get rid of it the fairgrounds is a large empty area in the heart of redmont&#39;s lower comercial zone that has fallen useless after the events world was introduced, that land could be used for prime realestate as many businesses originate near the fairgrouds</p>
<p>Alternatively a proportional tax could be introduced, a proposal can be something like</p>
<p>y = 0.15(x/100)^1.6</p>
<p>where y is the daily tax and x is the sum of all resell values of all commercial properties or otherwise someone owns, this formula can be tweaked for better results</p>
<p>This, would be a better solution then to limit ownership as a whole seeing as large properties such as c998 and c995 (largest plots in-game) currently pay the same tax as c725 (a tiny plot measuring 288 blocks squared) which by all means isnt fair</p>
<p>with the proposed formula c998 (10410 blocks squared) would pay $1900 in tax while c725 (288 blocks squared) would pay $64 in daily tax making the current system much fairer then lowering the plot limit.</p>
