      <h2>mezimori: Verncia’s personal personality cult</h2>
<p>-# DISCLAMER: This article has been built opon factual information avaliable to the public</p>
<p><strong>What is Mezimori?</strong>
Mezimori is a multi-service company owned by vernicia which GlobalCenter has estimated its worth at DC$9.2 million.
Mezimori’s services encompass a large portion of fields such as law, retail, finance and other industries such as production and banking
Mezimori is known for owning the mini russia district as its headquarters, its currently the largest continuous company headquarters in all of redmont, mezimori is devided into departments such as the legal department which many people hire to represent them in court</p>
<p><strong>MZ ban culture</strong>
MZ is known for banning individuals for disagreeing with or disliking their owner or the company itself, one example of which is dearev, current CEO of GlobalCenter and RBI director for acording to dearev “Doing RBI work”
Their sanctions list which was posted by toad <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1oHznRdvPFYP4IuL_E4_MV9Kz_W2ug3-ZBoryFUMZItE/htmlview#gid=0">here</a> shows that people are beinf held at a bailout to stop being banned for accepting some at incredibly high values such as dearev’s 300k which he himself said “im am not paying that, mz can go screw itself” it also includes arbitrary reasons such as “being ungrateful” 
Another deeply concerning part is MZ blocking building inspectors from doing their jobs as those who attempt to report mz plots for lawful reasons get banned for “attempting to seize mz land” congress has to act on this and criminalize this type of aggression against building inspectors and investigators
Dearev himself was listed with a DC$300,000 bailout demand on the sanctions list, to which he responded:
“I am not paying that. MZ can go screw itself.”
Some other concerns about this type of behavior is how hard it is to regulate it, MZ’s fast expansion leaves no room for other companies to compete which brings me to my next topic</p>
<p><strong>Field domination: monopoly DLC</strong></p>
<p>Mezimori’s influence goes far beyond a typical retail chain. Over the past year, it has quietly consolidated power across multiple economic sectors—from basic supply stores to niche service markets—effectively establishing itself as a soft monopoly in Redmont.
Altough this soft-monopoly is not technically illegal under monopoly laws it is making companies have a hard time establishing themselves mainly in the retail and legal markets</p>
<p>Through sheer volume of shop locations and persistent undercutting, Mezimori has created a market environment where most citizens cannot avoid interacting with the brand, even if they disagree with its leadership. Alongside its huge ban list it creates a system where no one can disagree with mezimori without suffering consequences 
By banning critics of the brand from their services which as mentioned before are almost impossible to not interact with it makes their living much harder This is their strategy to soft-silence critics of their brand and cult behavior </p>
<p><strong>typical cult behavior</strong>
Acording to the oxford dictionary a cult is “social groups which have unusual, and often extreme, religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs and rituals. Extreme devotion to a particular person, object, or goal is another characteristic often ascribed to cults.”</p>
<p>Some common characteristics of cults are:</p>
<p>Authoritarian leadership
Punishment for dissent
Loyalty-based tier system
Blacklisting critics
Worship of leader
No transparency</p>
<p>Mezimori fits most of these 
As their leadership is basically only vernicia which is  named “God Tsarina” in their group which if this isnt peak cult behavior idk what is, the mz council also isnt very open as far as I’ve researched about it</p>
<p>The tiered system 0-3 is also common within cults which is existanr within mz </p>
<p>Tier 0 - banned
Tier 1 - default
Tier 2 - Trusted
Tier 3 - friends or inner circle</p>
<p>Mezimori is an ethical and legalgray area, congress must work on this area and update the monopoly laws which has been pending an update for long. 
<strong>Vernicia’s ego</strong></p>
<p>It’s impossible to discuss Mezimori without addressing the sheer cult of personality surrounding its leader: Vernicia or as she is referred to within Mezimori’s own internal ranks, “God Tsarina.”
This is not satire. That title appears in official communications, and it reflects a broader pattern of self-glorification, ego-driven policy, and centralized decision-making that blurs the line between CEO and monarch.
Vernicia seems to have a God-complex within Mezimori’s ranks that we couldn’t find anywhere else in redmont.
The “sanctions list” itself reads less like a corporate disciplinary document and more like a list of personal grudges with people banned for vague offenses like “disrespect” or “being ungrateful.”
This level of personalization in a company’s enforcement behavior suggests that Mezimori is not governed by rules or principles, but by the emotional state and personal judgment of one person.
When economic participation in a server depends on the favor of a single unchecked individual, that’s no longer business it’s autocracy.</p>
