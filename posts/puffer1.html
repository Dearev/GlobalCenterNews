    <h1>A bigger Supreme Court -  A better Redmont!</h1>

      <p>The Redmont Supreme Court is the highest Court in the land, responsible for being both the last resort of appeals as well as being  the deciding voice on constitutional debates. There is only one problem: the Court is made up of two little judges.</p>
<p>The court, which is composed of 3 Justices, does not have enough Justices to preside over cases. Say, for example, one of the Justices has found himself in a legal conflict of interest in one of the cases presented to him. One would assume that the court could continue its job, but due to the precedent in the court, which requires all three judges to be a part of decorum, when one judge must excuse himself, the case is dismissed.</p>
<p>Take for example the appeal to the recent Federal Court Decision in the case “[2025] FCR 30”, in which the appeal has been kept on hold due to all three judges, having a conflict of interest in the case (With Cheif Justice Aladeen being the one to issue the verdict in federal court, and Justice Smallfires4 and Justice ko531, taking a part in the case).</p>
<p>When Justice has reached the case that it cannot take place due to there being too many judges, it must be taken into account that there is a problem in our system.
It is time for us to chage our legal system, and add more justices to our court.
It is now, or never!</p>
