      <p>The DCT recently has informed in a ticket that a standard they are refering to when evicting land for lack of commercial purpose is that 2/3 of the land in question has to be used for a commercial purpose, that being rentals, chestshops, HQ builds etc.</p>
<p>Upon Investigation, GlobalCenter Journalists Network (GCJN) has not found within the DCT&#39;s own Evictions policy this standard, and upon further investigation, we have found that previously this standard was not applied (we see that some notices were previously cleared with less then 2/3s of a plot being used for commercial purpose). This article, is a summary of our findings.</p>
<h2>2/3s</h2>
<p>When opening a ticket on the matter of the evictions on properties c478, c479, c480 and c481, The DCT said <em>&quot;c480/c81 is cleared. However in the case of c478/c479 only approximately 30% of the building is rentable. The rest is completely boarded up and inaccessible. So, as far as we can see, only 30% of the building has a commercial purpose. DCT policy requires around 2/3rds be used for a Commercial Purpose to be compliant.&quot;</em> after that, adding one more rental to the region, we were told that &quot;Currently, around 50% of the floor space on the ground floor and 20% of the floor space of the first floor is rentable, for a total commercial use of around 35% of the building. This is still not enough I&#39;m afraid. As mentioned, around 2/3rds of the building needs an actual commercial use for the report to be solved.&quot; after that, the dct was asked &quot;Btw where is it written that it needs to be 2/3rds?&quot; we were told that &quot;An inspection manager will answer your question shortly.&quot; as of publication, no answer has been provided.</p>
<p>In the meantime GCJN did some investigating in DCT policy, to be more specific the Evictions policy as it is what currently concerns us on this matter, GCJN was not able to find any mentions of the &quot;2/3 rule&quot; in the policy as of 28/12/2025 at 8pm EST</p>
<p>The current DCT policy states the following definition: &quot;A commercial purpose must be substantial, ongoing, and genuinely operational. Token setups—like a few dusty chest shops selling sticks and cobblestone or multiple chest shops selling the same item—do not qualify. Plots must demonstrate active trade, rentals, or services that reflect real engagement, not just a placeholder to dodge inactivity.&quot;</p>
<p>An example of the 2/3 rule not being applied by the DCT can be seen as an example in <a href="https://www.democracycraft.net/threads/c185-dec-7-2025.33094/">c185</a> where the notice was cleared after a couple of chestshops were added. and once again <a href="https://www.democracycraft.net/threads/c185-dec-29-2025.33715/">here</a> where the report to the same building was cleared after having only one rental clearly not constituting 2/3s of the building.</p>
<p>DCT policy states &quot;substancial, ongoing, and genuinely operational&quot; however the dct seems to be using arbitrary numerals to define what constitutes and what dosent. Which is different from what policy suggests. </p>
<p>GCJN will post a follow-up article on the situation once the DCT responds to our original question of where in policy is the 2/3s rule. GCJN comes to no conclusion with this article, but documents facts described in the DCT ticket.</p>
